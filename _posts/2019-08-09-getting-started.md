## Overview

In June 2025, I joined my **first-ever Capture the Flag (CTF)** competition: **Industrial Intrusion** on TryHackMe.  
The challenge simulated an **industrial control system (ICS)** environment. Our small team worked together to discover vulnerabilities, exploit services, and dig through clues. I was hesitant at firstâ€”I wasn't sure what I could contribute as a beginner but the experience turned out to be rewarding and motivating. As someone who learns best by *seeing* things, I naturally gravitated toward **OSINT** and cryptography.

## Key Experiences

- Gained **hands-on experience** in ICS-style scenarios  
- Practiced **team collaboration**: dividing tasks, sharing findings, and coordinating next steps  
- Focus areas in the room: **OSINT**, **web enumeration**, and **cryptography**

## Example Challenge  

OSINT 1

During the challenge, a critical piece of information was identified: a link to a GitHub repository, https://github.com/solstice-tech1/ot-auth-mirror/blob/main/index.html. This suggested that the website's source code, or at least a relevant part of it, was hosted there.

Initially, an attempt was made to directly paste or interact with this source on a live website, but it yielded no functional results. This indicated that the raw HTML was not intended for direct use in its current form.

Recognizing this, the next step involved examining the content for encoding. Upon closer inspection, the data appeared to be in a hexadecimal format, prompting an attempt to decode it from hexadecimal, which proved to be the correct approach for revealing the underlying information.

### Reflection

<<<<<<< HEAD
This was my first practical CTF and it taught me confidence: try things, document steps, and communicate with teammates. I still have a lot to learn, but this experience motivated me to continue practicing.
