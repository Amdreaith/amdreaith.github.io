## Overview

In June 2025, I joined my **first-ever Capture the Flag (CTF)** competition: **Industrial Intrusion** on TryHackMe.  
The challenge simulated an **industrial control system (ICS)** environment. Our small team worked together to discover vulnerabilities, exploit services, and dig through clues. I was hesitant at firstâ€”I wasn't sure what I could contribute as a beginner but the experience turned out to be rewarding and motivating. As someone who learns best by *seeing* things, I naturally gravitated toward **OSINT** and cryptography.

## Key Experiences

- Gained **hands-on experience** in ICS-style scenarios  
- Practiced **team collaboration**: dividing tasks, sharing findings, and coordinating next steps  
- Focus areas in the room: **OSINT**, **web enumeration**, and **cryptography**

## Example Challenge  

**Challenge (short):** Find a way to bypass the badge authentication system by interacting with an exposed web UI and uncover the hidden flag.

### Steps


1. **Port scan the target**
   ```bash
   nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.154.123
   ```

2. **Directory enumeration**
   ```bash
   gobuster dir -u "http://10.10.154.123:1880" \
     -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt \
     -x .txt,.html,.php,.bak -t 50
   ```
   
   Gobuster returned several directories. Notably, there were two /ui-style directories that differed only by case: `/ui` and `/UI`. Case differences can expose alternate resources; I tried both.

3. **Open the UI**  
   Visit: `http://10.10.154.123:1880/ui`  
   The UI presented controls (toggles) for systems such as a motion detector and a badge.

4. **Interact with the interface**  
   Toggle off the motion detector and the badge control, then refresh the page to confirm the new state. The UI reflected the changes and the backend accepted the new state.

5. **Result**  
   After disabling those features and refreshing, the gate authentication was effectively bypassed and the challenge revealed the flag.

### Reflection

This was my first practical CTF and it taught me confidence: try things, document steps, and communicate with teammates. I still have a lot to learn, but this experience motivated me to continue practicing.
