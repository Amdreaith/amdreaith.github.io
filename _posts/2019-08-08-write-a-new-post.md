 ### Competition Overview

In August 2025, I had the opportunity to join my team in the University Capture the Flag (UCTF) competition hosted by Trend Micro.
The event challenged us with problems in Reverse Engineering, Web Exploitation, Cryptography, and Forensics, each divided into Easy, Medium, and Hard levels.

The competition was fast-paced, running for just one hour (3:00 PM – 4:00 PM), which tested not only our technical skills but also how well we could think, decide, and collaborate under pressure.

Some of the challenges were Read, Scan As Is, and OSINT: Follow the Train. With such limited time, I’ll admit I couldn’t go through all the questions. 
That alone showed me how much preparation and quick thinking really matter in CTFs.

In the end, our team placed 87th out of 199 teams worldwide. Not bad, but I know we could’ve done better. I wish we had prepared more and communicated better. Honestly, 
some members weren’t that interested in the field, and that made it harder. But for me personally, I’m glad I joined and gave it a try.

Overall, it was a memorable and motivating experience. It opened my eyes to the importance of teamwork, preparation, and sharpening skills if I want to perform better in future CTFs.

### Reflections

Joining UCTF was both humbling and motivating. We didn’t rank near the top, but the experience gave me a lot to take away:

  - It opened my eyes to what global-level competition feels like in cybersecurity.

  - I realized how important specialization is in areas like reverse engineering, cryptography, and forensics.

  - Most importantly, it reminded me that CTFs aren’t just about winning — they’re about learning, growing, and building resilience with every challenge.
