## Competition Overview  

In **August 2025**, our team participated in the **University Capture the Flag (UCTF)** competition hosted by **Trend Micro**.  
The CTF featured challenges across multiple domains:  

- Reverse Engineering  
- Web Exploitation  
- Cryptography  
- Forensics  

The event was divided into three categories: **Easy, Medium, and Hard**. It ran from **3:00 PM to 4:00 PM**, giving participants only one hour to solve as many challenges as possible.  

Despite the intense competition, our team proudly placed **87th out of 199 teams worldwide**.

## Key Highlights  

- First experience competing in an **international CTF hosted by Trend Micro**.  
- Gained practical exposure to **time-sensitive problem-solving and collaboration**.  
- Identified areas for improvement, especially in **reverse engineering, forensics, and cryptography**.  
- Strengthened **team communication and coordination** under strict deadlines.

## Example Challenge — Forensics  

One memorable challenge involved analyzing a file that **contained another hidden file embedded within it**.  
This tested our ability to:  

- Use forensic tools to **extract and analyze hidden data**.  
- Recognize file signatures and embedded structures.  
- Apply critical thinking to unravel “a file inside a file” scenarios.  

While we didn’t solve every challenge, exercises like this gave us valuable insights into **real-world digital forensics techniques**.
