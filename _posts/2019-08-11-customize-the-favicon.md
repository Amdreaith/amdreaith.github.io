## Why I Started Blogging  

In May 2025, I decided to begin publishing articles and write-ups on **Medium**.  
My goal is simple: to **document my learning process**, track my progress, and share insights with others in the cybersecurity and tech community.  

I believe that **writing is one of the best ways to learn** .

I also really have a **passion for blogging** or editing some videos cause im into art , and I think this is the best way to capture and share some of my learnings. Even though there were times when some drafts or notes got **accidentally deleted**, I want to keep going. I know I’m just starting, but I hope I can create **valuable write-ups** in the near future.

## What I Write About  

So far, my focus has been on:  

- **CTF Write-Ups** → documenting steps and lessons from challenges I solved.  
- **Learning Notes** → summarizing key takeaways from courses, labs, and hands-on practice.  
- **Reflections** → personal thoughts on growth, mindset, and career direction.

## Example Topics  

- How I solved my first **TryHackMe room** step by step.  
- Lessons from Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.  
- Write-ups from **CTFs** like Industrial Intrusion and Trend Micro UCTF.  
- Reflections on persistence, consistency, and building cybersecurity skills.
