*Exploring the digital universe, one line of code at a time!*

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and tech learner on a journey to understand how things work and how to keep them safe. This blog is my digital notebook, where I document my learning process, share write-ups from CTF challenges, and reflect on my path in tech.

## 🚀 My Journey

I started actively learning cybersecurity through TryHackMe and the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. I believe that writing is one of the best ways to learn.

**Sometimes I feel like a jack of all trades, but my true goal is to master the things I genuinely love most.**

## 💫 Fun Facts About Me

When I'm not diving into cybersecurity, you'll find me:
- **🎨 Painting** - expressing creativity through colors and canvases.
- **🎵 Jamming to music** - I know some basic guitar chords, haha! 
- **🏃‍♂️ Going for runs** - nothing clears the mind like a good run.
- **📺 Watching self-help and motivation videos** - as a girl, I love watching TED Talks, podcasts, and other inspiring content
- **🏀 Shooting hoops** - had so much fun playing basketball during school, but I know I suck at it 😄
- **🗣️ Public speaking** - I love speaking in public places.
